# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary & Product Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement and Solution Summary

**Problem:** Students, especially teenagers and young adults, often face isolation, lack of motivation, and disorganization when studying alone. This leads to poor academic performance and decreased mental well-being.

**Solution:** "Study Buddy" is a web-based platform built using Django that allows students to find and join peer study groups based on subjects of interest. The application enables structured collaboration, accountability, and social interaction among students.

### 1.2 Target User Personas and Market Analysis

* **High School Students (13-18):** Preparing for exams, homework support, motivation.
* **College Students (18-25):** Focused study sessions, project collaborations, social learning.
* **First-year Students:** Seeking peer groups to connect socially and academically.

**Market Opportunity:** With increasing online and hybrid learning models, there's a growing need for peer-to-peer academic support systems. Study Buddy taps into this need by offering a lightweight, easy-to-use collaboration tool without requiring third-party integrations or apps.
